# DevMountain Tracker

Students of DevMountain, a Web Dev Full-Time Immersive Bootcamp, use The Q to notify mentors and instructors that a student is in need of help. All data regarding when the student entered The Q, how long it took them to receive help, and how long the mentor was helping them is stored. It also stores information regarding attendance and whether a student is on time, late, left early, or stayed the whole day. The Q is used to keep track of student progress throughout their time at DevMountain.
 
We took all that data from The Q to build a web application, emphasizing in data visualization, giving the instructors a more comprehensive view of how each student, cohort, and the overall bootcamp is doing.

DevMountain Passport was used to create a login to limit the access of The DevMountain Tracker to Instructors and Lead Mentors.

Using Socket.io the DevMountain Tracker displays real-time red alerts when there is a long wait for a student to get help in one of the classrooms so other mentors or instructors can assist them.

Daily alerts are also displayed in the alert section which pull attendance information, large Q time percentages, and progress concerns of specific students. 

D3 is used to create the graphs displaying the status of The Q information everyday. The Total Q Time graph is drawn in real-time as the day goes on to show the most current status of the overall bootcamp.
